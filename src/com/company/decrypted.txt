tokyo ( A p)  —  it began with a virus and a yearlong pause.  it ended with a typhoon blowing through and,  still,  a virus.  in between:  just about everything.
 
the tokyo olympics,  christened with “ caca”  but held in mid- cacb after being interrupted for a year by the coronavirus,  glided to their conclusion in a covid- emptied stadium sunday night as an often surreal mixed bag for japan and for the world.
 
A  rollicking closing ceremony with the theme “ worlds we share”  —  an optimistic but ironic notion at this human moment —  featured everything from stunt bikes to intricate light shows as it tried to convey a “ celebratory and liberating atmosphere”  for athletes after a tense two weeks.
it was set to pivot to a live feed from paris,  host of the cace summer games.
A nd with that,  the strangest olympic games on record began closing their books for good.
